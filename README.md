#SIG - System Information Gatherer  
[A programm that gathers some information about your Linux distribution and stores it in a file.]
  
  
###description:
The script "startGathering.sh" starts itself with "start" as (first) argument. So it gathers all the information.
All outputs of "startGathering.sh "start"" will be stored in the a file with the name: info@"current date"
(for example: "current date" == info@28.02.2013).
